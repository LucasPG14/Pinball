This is a project for the Physics II subject, at CITM (UPC, Terrassa).
Consists of a 2D Pinball, using Box2D as the main Physics Engine.

## Controls
- Use A or D to move the flippers. Above and below move simultaneously 
- Space to kick the ball at the beggining
- + and - keys to control volume

## Debug Keys
- F1 to see the chains, boxes and circles that handle the collisions

- Group of 3 triangles lighted = 20 points
- Enter flippers through side rails (white entrance) = 50 points
- Enter flippers through side rails (red entrance) = 100 points
- Enter middle or top rails = 50 points
- Activate all 3 lights  on top right part of the map (S, K, V) = 500 points
